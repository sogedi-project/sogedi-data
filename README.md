# SOGEDI DATA

This repository contains the processed SOGEDI survey data and associated documentation, contributing to the “Socioeconomic and Gender Disparities: A Multi-Country Study” (SOGEDI). This project examines attitudinal processes, stereotypes, intergroup emotions, behavioral patterns, and perceptions of social inequality regarding both women and men in contexts of poverty and wealth across several Spanish-speaking countries.

Included here are the questionnaire, dataset, codebook, and related documentation. These materials form part of the R&D&I project “Antecedentes, manifestaciones y consecuencias del clasismo ambivalente” (PID2022-136736NA-I00), funded by MCIN/AEI/10.13039/501100011033/ and FEDER (“Una forma de hacer Europa”), and supported by the Centro de Estudios sobre Conflicto y Cohesión Social (COES) (ANID/FONDAP/1523A0005) through the work of Gloria Jiménez-Moya and Mario Sainz.

Use of these data requires proper citation of the project’s references and funding sources. To request data access, please contact:

## Repository and reproducibility

The data and code files are hosted both in the [Open Science Framework project](https://osf.io/nv6rs/) and in the GitHub repository [sogedi-data](https://github.com/Andreas-Lafferte/sogedi-data). They follow the logic of the [IPO protocol](https://github.com/juancarloscastillo/ipo) for academic workflows, based on three main components = **I**nput -> **P**rocessing -> **O**utput.
