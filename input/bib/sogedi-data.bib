  abstract = {The objective of this paper is to validate a Spanish short version of the Ambivalent Sexism Inventory (ASI: Glick \& Fiske, 1996) and of the Ambivalence Toward Men Inventory (AMI: Glick \& Fiske, 1999) using a random sample of 1.113 Spanish students (50,1\% female and 49,9\% male) with ages ranging from 14 to 18 years (mean age = 15.4; SD:1.1). Results show that the Spanish short version of the ASI (12 items) and the AMI (12 items) are reliable and valid. These findings confirm the hypothesis that hostility and benevolence form two distinct subsystems on both scales (ASI and AMI), and that they represent opposing assessments toward women and men. El objetivo de esta investigaci{\'o}n consisti{\'o} en comprobar la fiabilidad y la validez de la naturaleza multidimensional de la versi{\'o}n reducida de las escalas de Sexismo Ambivalente hacia Mujeres (ASI: Glick y Fiske, 1996) y hacia Hombres (AMI: Glick y Fiske, 1999). Se cont{\'o} con una muestra representativa nacional de 1.113 estudiantes de educaci{\'o}n secundaria obligatoria. De todos ellos, un 50,1\% son chicas y un 49,9\% son chicos, con un rango de edad comprendido entre los 14 y los 18 a{\~n}os, siendo la media de 15.4 (SD: 1.1). Nuestros resultados confirman la estabilidad de la estructura factorial de las versiones reducidas de la Escala de Sexismo Ambivalente (ASI) y de la Escala de Actitudes Ambivalentes hacia Hombres (AMI), como tambi{\'e}n su adecuada fiabilidad. Por consiguiente, se concluy{\'o} que ambas escalas son aptas para medir las actitudes sexistas ambivalentes hacia los g{\'e}neros.},

  abstract = {The current paper assesses the psychometric properties of short versions of the Ambivalent Sexism Inventory (ASI; Glick \& Fiske, 1996) and Ambivalence Toward Men Inventory (AMI; Glick \& Fiske, 1999), which represent widely used measures of sexist attitudes toward, respectively, women and men. Participants in the study were 960 Caucasian adults (48.6\% male). The theoretical structure of both the short ASI and AMI was tested via confirmatory factor analysis using structural equations modeling. Moreover, the invariance of the factor structures across gender and age was investigated. Results showed that the shorter versions of the ASI and AMI have good psychometric properties that are consistent with the original versions of the scales. Researchers who wish to assess ambivalent sexist attitudes, but must use fewer items than the original ASI and AMI, can strongly consider using these short versions.

  abstract = {Introduction: Hostile and benevolent classism influence the derogation of poor people and groups, with negative consequences. The present study aims to adapt and validate the Ambivalent Classism Inventory (ACI) to obtain an adequate tool for expanding research on this topic among the Spanish-speaking population. Method: Toward this end, the researchers back-translated the ACI version originally developed for English speakers. Exploratory and confirmatory analyses verify the ACI's reliability and factor structure with a sample of Mexican participants. Results: The results demonstrated that the adapted scale's psychometric properties are acceptable. Its original and factor structure are similar to those of the original scale: hostile classism (12 items), protective paternalism (4 items), and complementary class differentiation (4 items). Furthermore, the study tests the convergent and divergent validity of the scale{\textasciiacute}s sub-dimensions concerning other ideological and socioeconomic variables. Conclusion: The proposed ACI adaptation should contribute to understanding attitudes toward the poor as well as their consequences among Spanish speakers.},

  abstract = {Perceptions of gender inequality may motivate people to take action against inequality given its negative impact on various domains of people's everyday lives. Thus, it is crucial to develop reliable measures that consider the multidimensional nature of gender inequalities. In this research, we propose and assess the psychometric properties of the Multidimensional Gender Inequality Perception Scale (MuGIPS). This is a self-reported measure of perceived gender inequality in four domains: health, violence, household work and caregiving, and public sphere and power. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses were conducted to test the validity and reliability of the MuGIPS with Spanish participants in three samples (N = 1733). The analyses revealed that the MuGIPS had a good internal consistency and showed four factors associated with gender inequality in the four specified domains. Moreover, scores in all the dimensions positively correlated with feminist identity and feminist ideology, as much as with some attitudinal variables. In contrast, results showed a negative correlation with system-justifying ideologies. The MuGIPS shows adequate reliability and validity for measuring the perception of gender inequality in the health, violence, household work and caregiving, and public sphere and power domains among Spanish university and general population samples.},
